      <p>Last year, when we went to the tiny house, I loved the idea of living with together, with no opps. This whole year, I've been so glad to live that dream at nora, and it makes me so, so, so excited for next year when I actually get to be your roomate. I was so sick last year and you took such nice care of me, it was so sweet. We made those bomb-ass burgers, then covered up that big scary window. Then we hit Applebee's for the 50 cent wings and you got your little tacos. Classic us :) </p>

      <p>We went to pike haha. I actually think this was the most recent frat event we went to together. It was fun seeing Leland and people I knew in Pike, but what made it really nice for me was that you were there with me and you were having a good time. I always appreciate when you do your best to be social in scary settings! It feels really validating and makes me feel appreciated and cared about. More recently, I loved when you came to DKE and hung out at the freaky party with Merida. I just like when you are willing to be social and independent, it is such an attractive color on you and you do such a good job trying hard for me. Even though I know you would rather stay at home with me and watch tv and be so fat with the cat <3 </p>

We'd drive all over the place between Seattle and your house and my house and I'd always love doing the apple dance in the car. Just so cute! Thank you for always being my aux in the car, I like hearing your music, and love seeing how you get so excited to go to concerts. Its just so adorable. I've never been a huge concert goer so I like sharing that with you and doing that fun stuff together. </p>

    <p>We made some tasty tasty charcuterie for new year's eve and as a suprise bonus we watched the space needle drone show and fireworks from the window! That was so cool. We got to show papaya fireworks for the first time (even though he didn't really notice them) and be there for his first new year! I remember when we watched the drones through your window and since the TV was a bit behind, we would try and guess what they were making even though they were angled weird and away from us. That was a fun time. </p>

I was so hopped up on caffine it was making me tweak like that time you took the test after we went to solstice cafe. I stocked up my whole backpack with swag for me and a bunch of energy drinks for you. I liked that you came over and sat with me on the bench in red square and I brought you a pizza slice and we had a little dinner together. I like that even just for a little bit we could hang out and chat. I think its very nice how you always want to talk to me. Like when you call me whenever you have free time walking somewhere. Sometimes I don't want to call, but I always pick up for you, and end up being happy I did. I like getting to yap at you and hearing you yap at me since you are so good at it you yappy yapper.</p>

      <p>When he first learned how to hop up on the counter, I couldn't even prepare for his greed. He was trying to snatch food left and right. I think he's gotten much better at not jumping up while I'm cooking, but once I'm done, oh oh oh, that counter is all his. He learned all about the comfort of the drying cloth and even though he's dead to me, it is just the cutest thing. It is gross I stand by that, but I woudln't trade it for anything. I love his grubby little mitts. That was funny though: having to learn to protect the drying cloth from his greedy little loaf. </p>

    <p>We went to the Chicago Art Institute twice in one day and to the contemporary art museum. I love going to art museums SO much. I think they're so much fun. The way I've always done museums with my family has been like a "lets meet up in 2 hrs when we leave, meet at the entrance" type of thing. And I really like to just look and wander alone, so I was admittedly a little concerned that I wouldn't like it as much since I knew you would want to do all of it together - but it was great and super fun! I liked talking about the art with you and complaining about the jesus area and talking about all the little (remade) penars. It was pretty fun getting to walk all over that huge place and get to look at and chat about and take pictures of the art together. Thanks for doing that with me, it meant so much and it was something I really wanted to do.</p>

    <p>This was a pretty funny game, idk who it was against but we won of course. i think it was the game when we got all those chick fil-a gift cards and you even saved me and cameron and brycen a spot to get mcdonalds fries! That was so nice of you! Then we got these hella swag ponchos and beared the rain to watch the game. It's pretty impressive how into football you are. I've never been a big football guy, but you've turned me into an enjoyer. Remember when you would have to literally teach me the rules when we first started going to games? So cute I like seeing you competitive and having fun. Even though I always get so tired and want to leave, I admire your dedication to stay the whole time, and will always sit and watch with you, even in the rain. Maybe you're the reason why we're undefeated at home.</p>

    <p>When stupid Nora had to do room inspections and Paya was still illegal, we had to carry him and all of his stuff over to dke. He got to hang with me for the day, I skipped my class, and we napped together. It was pretty cute and he loved to explore my room. He was very confuseed about the bathroom floor since it was warm, so he would lay on the chistmas bathmat we bought together and put his head on the floor. Eventually he warmed up to it and just lounged all the way on the warm tile. So ute! </p>

We went to applebees hella late because I was studying (all your idea and it was a good idea), we went to applebees and split a pasta so we could save up for chicago! Then we also dressed up a bit and went to the place in seattle, but the streets were too packed! I was stressed beceause I wanted to take you out to a nice date and it wasn't working, but you were so supportive and nice so we went to bellevue and it was great!

I liked dressing up a little fancier so we could be sexy mysterious indie couple doing homework together. That was super super fun. Then we went and got bagels and wandered around a little. Also while we were there, I went to explore the bathroom and when I got back you asked me how it all worked to get the card and scan it. I like that. I like when you ask me for help and I get to help you so you don't have to worry about anything. But lets keep going to new coffee shops!</p>

It was such a nice day-turned-night and it was so sweet that you planned that for us. We bought garlic fries and squeezed each other's legs to tickle them and generally made everyone around us annoyed probably but that's ok! We're the only ones that matter!
