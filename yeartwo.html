      <p>I remember...</p>
      <p>When we went to the zoo lights with my family during christmas break. That was super fun and oh so cute. I liked walking around and looking at the lights with you and making fun of the silly looking animals. I even liked holding the umbrella for you. Isn't it so fun that you are just like a part of the gang now? You're such a veteran girlfriend and its a good look on you and makes me feel really secure. I really like being with my family and with you, it just feels so natural to have you there with me, and my family really likes you. I really appreciate how you want to hang out with them, it is a really nice quality you have and I love you lots and so do they. </p>

    <p>I remember...</p>
    <p>When stupid Nora had to do room inspections and Paya was still illegal, we had to carry him and all of his stuff over to dke. He got to hang with me for the day, I skipped my class, and we napped together. It was pretty cute and he loved to explore my room. He was very confuseed about the bathroom floor since it was warm, so he would lay on the chistmas bathmat we bought together and put his head on the floor. Eventually he warmed up to it and just lounged all the way on the warm tile. So ute! </p>
