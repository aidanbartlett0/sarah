      <p>I remember...</p>
      <p>Last year, when we went to the tiny house, I loved the idea of living with together, with no opps. This whole year, I've been so glad to live that dream at nora, and it makes me so, so, so excited for next year when I actually get to be your roomate. I was so sick last year and you took such nice care of me, it was so sweet. We made those bomb-ass burgers, then covered up that big scary window. Then we hit Applebee's for the 50 cent wings and you got your little tacos. Classic us :) </p>
