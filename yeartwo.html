      <p>I remember...</p>
      <p>When we went to my house for the first time and you got to meet my family and my grandparents (surprise)! Then we went to the beach to watch the sunset until we got scared of the raccoons and had to run away. And then I scared you and I felt bad, I don't like to scare you and I didn't again. I got to show you my beloved at-home fit (big honor) and you clowned on me (lame as hell (can't handle the toughness of my fit)). Twas pretty fun. Then my mom drove us up to school so she could hang out with us more as it was all very new and exciting to her (shes still always so excited to see you) </p>

She even bought me food and that was so nice of her and you! So sweet, you have always taken such good care of me and talked me up to all of your family and always made them have a good picture of me I really appreciate it</p>
