      <p>When he first learned how to hop up on the counter, I couldn't even prepare for his greed. He was trying to snatch food left and right. I think he's gotten much better at not jumping up while I'm cooking, but once I'm done, oh oh oh, that counter is all his. He learned all about the comfort of the drying cloth and even though he's dead to me, it is just the cutest thing. It is gross I stand by that, but I woudln't trade it for anything. I love his grubby little mitts. That was funny though: having to learn to protect the drying cloth from his greedy little loaf. </p>

    <p>Papaya finally started to outgrow his festive holiday sweater when he started getting too big and fat :( Then it became a straightjacket and would paralyze him so much haha. I think its funny how we have to put his timeout sweater on him when he starts acting evil. Such a little rascal</p>
